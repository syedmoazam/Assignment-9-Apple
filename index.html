                            According to Reuters, Italy has registered 94,171 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the seventh-highest in the world. The country has reported 2.74 million cases to date.

                            When the coronavirus pandemic took hold in India, there were fears it would sink the fragile health system of the world’s second-most populous country, AP reports. Infections climbed dramatically for months and at one point India looked like it might overtake the United States as the country with the highest case toll.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But infections began to plummet in September, and now the country is reporting about 11,000 new cases a day, compared to a peak of nearly 100,000, leaving experts perplexed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They have suggested many possible explanations for the sudden drop — seen in almost every region — including that some areas of the country may have reached herd immunity or that Indians may have some preexisting protection from the virus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Indian government has also partly attributed the dip in cases to mask-wearing, which is mandatory in public in India and violations draw hefty fines in some cities. But experts have noted the situation is more complicated since the decline is uniform even though mask compliance is flagging in some areas.

                            One year into the Covid-19 pandemic, many millions of N95 masks are pouring out of American factories and heading into storage, reports AP. Yet doctors and nurses in the US say there still aren’t nearly enough in the <q>ICU rooms with high-flow oxygen and Covid germs all over</q>.

                        <p>
                            Internal government emails obtained by The Associated Press show there were deliberate decisions to withhold vital information about new mask manufacturers and availability. Exclusive trade data and interviews with manufacturers, hospital procurement officials and frontline medical workers reveal a communication breakdown — not an actual shortage — that is depriving doctors, nurses, paramedics and other people risking exposure to Covid-19 of first-rate protection.

                        <p>
                            Despite efforts by the health department to expedite the process of vaccination, only around 700 healthcare workers have gotten themselves vaccinated against Covid-19 during the last two weeks
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Those who got the shots blamed the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) and lack of awareness for the delay. Though 14 adult vaccination centres (AVCs) have been established in the capital, only six are functional.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to maintain a database and ensure the vaccine is administered only to healthcare workers, the government has made Nadra verification of those coming for vaccination mandatory. Besides hospitals, the centres have also been set up in different parts of the capital.

                            Japan is scrambling to secure special syringes to maximise the number of Covid-19 vaccine shots used from each vial, but manufacturers are struggling to ramp up production quickly, raising fears that millions of doses could go waste.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Japan, with a population of 126 million, last month signed a contract with Pfizer Inc to procure 144 million doses of its vaccine, or enough for 72 million people, with the vaccination campaign set to start on Wednesday.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One vial is meant for six shots, Pfizer says, but it takes special syringes that retain a low volume of solution after an injection to extract six doses, while only five shots can be taken with standard syringes that the government has stored up in preparation for the inoculation drive, according to Reuters.

                            <q>We are still trying to secure these special syringes,</q> Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said.

                            The Palestinian Authority (PA) accused Israel of holding up the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines into Gaza, where Palestinians have yet to receive any doses.

                        <p>
                            A Palestinian official told Reuters that the PA tried to send 2,000 doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine from the occupied West Bank to Gaza on Monday, but that Israel stopped the shipment at a West Bank checkpoint <q>and informed the Palestinians there was no approval to continue to Gaza.</q>

                        <p>
                            An Israeli security official said the PA’s request to send the 2,000 doses was <q>still being examined</q> and that <q>an approval hasn’t yet been given</q>.

                            <q>My priority is to make sure I vaccinate the UK adult population as quickly as we can and then if there are any excess doses, we will look at how we make those excess doses available to other countries,</q> Zahawi told LBC radio.
